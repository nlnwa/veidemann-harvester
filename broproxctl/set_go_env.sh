# Script to set the GO environment to the same values as used by the mvn-golang-wrapper plugin.
# This way it is possible do developement without the need to run maven for every build.
# Note that you should run mvn package once to set up dependencies first.
#
# Usage:
#   mvn package
#   eval $(./set_go_env.sh)
#   go install broproxctl
